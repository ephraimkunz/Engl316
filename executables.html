            <p>
                Executables, also known as binaries, are files containing computer-readable instructions.
                <br/><br/>
                These instructions are often in machine code: random letters and numbers to the human eye.

            <p>
                Technically, you could write a computer program with these random letters and numbers. However, it is much easier to write human-readable code, or ‘source’ code.
                <br/><br/>
                Source code is translated into machine code before it can be executed by a computer. An executable will often contain additional machine code on top of the source code 
                it translated. This extra code is based on the language you used to write the source code - the Java language, for instance, will add machine code that cleans up memory
                and handles code exceptions.
                <br/><br/>

            <h3>The main point:  </h3>
            <p>
                Computers have to translate coding languages into their unique machine language before executing them.
