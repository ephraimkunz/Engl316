                        A “Hello, World!” program is a program written in any programming language which displays a simple message (usually “Hello, World!”) to the user.  This program is generally introduced as the first program a beginner will write as it is the simplest program that does something useful (i.e., sends a message to the user).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        A “Hello, World!” program is also encountered in other contexts:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It is used by experienced programmers to verify that a programming environment is installed and configured correctly
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This program may be written by experienced programmers to learn syntax and usage of an unfamiliar programming language
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Samples of these programs are available in many languages from official software repositories (a collection of software packages) to demonstrate how repositories may be created and installed
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The term “Hello, World!” is also used to describe a beginning task for any software related tool.  For <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">example</a>, Github, a popular Distributed Version Control host, provides guides on using its service for the first time in a “Hello World” tutorial.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The message communicated by the program may or may not be “Hello, World!”.  Well known books and references in widely used languages (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#.22Hello_world.22_example">Java</a>, <a href="http://asm.sourceforge.net/intro/hello.html">Assembly</a>) use variants of this message.  Some languages have other idiomatic variants, such as in Haskell where first programs are sometimes simple <a href="https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/starting-with-haskell/basics-of-haskell/2-my-first-program">arithmetic</a> or <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/recursion#hello-recursion">recursive</a> functions.  Other computer languages such as Verilog do not have the ability to easily display text and use methods such as blinking lights to achieve the output of a “Hello, World!” program.  A large collection of "Hello, World!" programs is maintained <a href="https://helloworldcollection.github.io/">here</a>.
