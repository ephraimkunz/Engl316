                Your First C Program
            </h1>
            <h3>Introduction</a></h3>
            <p>
                    This tutorial will teach you how to build and run your first computer program. 
                    It will use the programming language C, a common language that is used everywhere that software is written. 
                    Your program will be simple, just printing a few lines to the screen. But it is the stepping stone for bigger and better programs.

                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <strong>Warning:</strong> Microsoft Word or other word processors are not suitable for use as coding text editors.
                </div>
                <li>
                    The text editor will launch with a new document. Save your new empty file as <i>helloworld.c</i> to the Desktop.
                </li>
                <li> In the <i>helloworld.c</i> file, type or copy and paste the following: <br><br>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

                        int main() {

                    </pre>
                    Click <a href="./helloWorldProgram.html">here</a> to understand what the lines you just typed will do.
                    <div class="alert alert-warning">
                        <strong>Warning:</strong> Computers can be very nitpicky about spacing, punctuation, and capitalization.
                        For all the text you will type or copy and paste in this tutorial, make sure that you match our spacing, punctuation, and capitalization exactly.
                        If the computer doesn't do what you expected when you type a command, double check your typing!
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Save <i>helloworld.c</i>
                </li>
                <li>Open the Bash terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t. Learn more about the terminal <a href="./shell.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li>In the terminal window, type <code>cd Desktop</code> and press enter to navigate to the Desktop. The prompt the shell gives you will change to show that you are now on the Desktop.</li>
                <li>In the terminal, type <code>gcc helloworld.c</code> and press enter to compile the program. If everything worked, nothing should be printed on the screen except for a new prompt. Learn more about gcc <a href="./theGccCompiler.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li>In the terminal, type <code>./a.out</code> and press enter to run the program. If everything worked, you should see the words "Hello World!" printed on a line by themselves in the shell. Learn more about what you just ran <a href="./executables.html">here</a>.</li>
