                    A computer terminal is a program that allows a user to interact with the computer’s operating system through text commands.
                    Visually, a terminal is a single window that displays text input from a user and text output from the computer.
                    Just as a computer desktop allows a user to navigate through folders and run programs by clicking buttons, a terminal exposes the same functionality to users through predefined text commands.
                    These text commands typically allow a user to have as much or more control over the computer than is available through graphical menus and buttons.

                    Some users prefer using their operating system through a computer terminal because the text format presents a fast, ergonomic, and customizable way to accomplish computing tasks.
                    Terminal use is considered fast and ergonomic because a user’s hands never have to leave the keyboard while working.
                    Computer terminals are customizable because repetitive tasks can be automated through short, custom-built programs.
                    These advantages that make a terminal work flow attractive to computing specialists are also disadvantages to casual users.
                    There is a high learning curve before a user can reap the benefits of computing through a terminal.
                    Text commands must be entered in exactly as the computer expects them without any room for error.
                    Also, since most people are used to navigating an operating system through graphical menus, the text format is new and often unintuitive to inexperienced users.

                    Since terminal commands are a way of interacting with a specific operating system, the text commands are different for each operating system.
                    Examples of commands for a Unix based operating system (Linux, Mac OS) are given below.
                    Commands are typed into a terminal followed by ‘Enter’ to begin their execution.
