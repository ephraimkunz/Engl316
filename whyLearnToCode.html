                Why Learn To Code?

            <p>
                    Learning to code is in practically every way, learning a new language.  It does take work, but, it teaches you how to think!  Among the more obvious benefits are learning how to build programs and learning how to more fully control your technological life.  Learning how to code helps your brain to make different connections and it teaches you how to more effectively solve problems.  If you keep learning to code after this tutorial, you will eventually be able to fix your mom’s computer to answer some of those questions she always asks you, so when you go visit your parents you can actually eat with the family rather than in front of the computer while you’re finding and fixing things.
